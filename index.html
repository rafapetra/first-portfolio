  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <img src="IMG/portfolio.jpeg" alt="A profile picture.">
    <p>I am originally from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and have been living in the US for over ten years.</p><p>I currently live in Portland, OR and I decided to take a class on programming for various reasons: I simply enjoy it and used to do it as a hobbie when I was a teenager. </p><p>I graduated from Portland State University and after working in various industries, I am seeking a career change that would allow me to work remotely and visit my family more often. Besides coding, I am passionate about nature, movies, music and drawing. 

    I also enjoy graphic design and video editing using Adobe Creative Cloud.
